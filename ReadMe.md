# CS 1.2: Intro to Data Structures

Available at https://sf-tweet-generator.herokuapp.com/

## Course Description
A project based course that looks under the hood at data structures and algorithms to see how they work. In addition to implementing these structures in an application; students will build them from scratch, analyze their complexity, and benchmark their performance to gain an understanding of their tradeoffs and when to use them in practice. Students will write scripts, functions, and library modules to use text processing tools like regular expressions, construct and sample probability distributions to create a Markov language model and gain insight into how grammar works and natural language processing techniques.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:
1.   Create Python programs that read and write text files and manipulate strings
2.   Implement core data structures including singly linked lists and hash tables
3.   Build web apps with the Flask framework and deploy to the web
4.   Construct and sample probability distributions based on observed word frequencies
5.   Create Markov language models and use them to generate new sentences
6.   Use unit tests that assert correct behavior of functions and classes
7.   Analyze the complexity of iterative algorithms and data structures with visual loop counting

### Quiz Policy

A total of 3 quizzes will be given in class. If the student experiences an unexpected event such as a medical issue or a family emergency the student may be approved to retake the quiz during testing center hours within a week of when the quiz was given. To be approved to retake a missed quiz the student must communicate with the instructor prior to the quiz date.

### Practice Questions (PQ) Policy

Practice Questions will not be graded and will be treated as extra opportunities to learn. We will go over the solutions in class on the dates in the tables above. In order to get the most out of these learning opportunties try to complete them before we go over them in class.

### Project Demo Policy

Each demo students will demonstrate completion of coding challenges in the project tutorial. Each demo will consist of two components: 
1. Demonstrating that the code is complete
2. Being able to answer conceptual interview type questions about the code
   
If you do not pass the demo the first time you will be given an opportunity to retake the demo and bring your grade up to passing after recieving feedback. 

## Evaluation Criteria

To pass this course, students must meet the following requirements:
-   Complete the required project tutorial
-   Pass the project demos according to the associated [project rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a8xQX1xAWTZjuXjhPdeQc2-FkEcK5eJpqaAPtfFDqZE/edit?folder=1yzsaKL-ywY-2Gn_IgAKCoTtkWD8Wgx96)
